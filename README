Welcome to the Shadow file password cracker.

Program Summary:

This program is written in the python programming language. (1)The user is prompted to enter the file
path of the shadow file. (2) The user must enter the username of the account that needs to be cracked.
(3) The users hash data string is then extracted and split accordingly into a "salt" and "key" A password
dictionary located in the "dictionary.txt" file is then read line by line and used with the
crypt.crypt function. This output is then compared with the SHA-512 indicator concatenated with the salt
and saved key. Once the password is found in the dictionary it will be displayed on the screen and the program
will terminate.
